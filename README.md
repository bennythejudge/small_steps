# small steps in Golang

- I found [this](https://qr.ae/TW8Y0U) list of ideas to develop: 

```
- An echo server (a server that returns whatever is sent)

- A service that tells time

- A service that makes a Google search and returns title of top 5

A service that returns API results from a third party service, for example searching books on Google Books or products on Amazon.
After building these to return plain text on raw sockets or maybe JSON on http, then try to make them fault-tolerant, for example disconnect the machine from the internet and make your service handle that situation of not reaching Amazon API.

Then try to add some parameters to requests.

After playing with these, you will be quite comfortable with a lot of features of the language with only minimal use of the standard library. After that, try to add more features, a web interface (now you are ready!), alternative input/output formats, etc.
